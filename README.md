# Employee-Attrition-Prediction 
 
- In this project, I perform a complete machine learning work flow from data exploratory and feature engineering to build different machine learning models and evaluate model performances to predict if an employee will leave his/her current employer and analyze what features will mainly affect employee's attrition activity.  
- Achieved good accuracy on the dataset, using Logistic Regression with Hyperparameter Optimization.
 
# Contents of the Project
